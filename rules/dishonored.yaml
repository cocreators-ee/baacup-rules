name: Dishonored
issues: |
  At least when restoring a quicksave, the game crashes if you try to instantly load it.
  It seems you have to quit and restart the game before loading a restored file.
platforms:
  windows:
    executable: "*\\Dishonored.exe"
    savegames:
      - "${ProgramFiles(x86)}\\Steam\\userdata\\*\\205100\\remote\\*.sav"  # Steam
