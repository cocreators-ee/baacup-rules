# Contributing to Baacup

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We use reasonable development practices

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull
requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same
[GPLv3 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project.

## Report issues using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/cocreators-ee/baacup-rules/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by
[opening a new issue](https://github.com/cocreators-ee/baacup-rules/issues/new); it's that easy!

Issues are intended to report _bugs_ or other issues with the existing rules, not that rules are
missing for some specific game. If rules are missing, feel free to contribute them, but it's
pointless to report them as missing because there are going to be a near infinite list of things
that ARE missing.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and examples

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code or other example data if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't
  work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent style

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install) to format the files. You can try to manually
match the format of other similar files, but you have to follow it accurately, as automatic
formatting tools are not forgiving.
